[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

**Python Code**  
```{python}
import random
rand_list = [random.random() for i in range(0, 1000)]

# PMF Plot
rand_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand_list)
thinkplot.Pmf(rand_pmf, linewidth = 0.05)
thinkplot.show(xlabel = 'Number', ylabel = 'PDF')

# CDF Plot
rand_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand_list)
thinkplot.Cdf(rand_cdf)
thinkplot.show(xlabel = 'Number', ylabel = 'CDF')
```

**Results**  
Based off of the plots that were generated by the python code above, we can conclude that the the distribution is uniform as it appears that there is an equal probability for all the random numbers to appears in the PMF plot and there is a linear relationship between the CDF values and the random number values in the CDF plot.
